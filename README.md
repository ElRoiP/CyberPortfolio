# <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/elroipablo/">El Roi Pablo</a>'s Cybersecurity Portfolio 

Welcome to my cybersecurity project portfolio! This repository showcases hands-on projects where I explore real-world security challenges such as vulnerability management, threat detection, security monitoring, and incident response. I’m passionate about learning through practical experience and enjoy understanding how security tools and processes work at a deeper level. Whether you’re a recruiter, fellow security professional, or just curious about cybersecurity, feel free to explore the projects and reach out if you’d like to connect.
